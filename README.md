# fract_api

<b>What is it?</b></br>
A platform for allowing customers to view availability & book in real-time VBS employed FTEs/consultants only for the duration needed, thereby preventing costs accrued due to unutilized hours.

<b>Why?</b></br>
In existing engagements, customers have reservations against being charged for bench hours especially during periods of prolonged low utilization.
Even if customers donâ€™t have reservations, we can still showcase this as a value add to help them save costs and strengthen relationships.
In our meetings with potential customers, a question on bench strength is frequently asked.
